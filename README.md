# Requirements

# Introduction
An electrical Energy management based on fixed priorities of the loads is considered a conventional implementation as applied in today’s aircraft systems. It can cut and reconnect loads depending on their importance. Further implementations are depicted that are able to eliminate certain drawbacks of such a typical load management
# Objective
The main objective of the project is to Reduce the enegy consumption of the Aircraft  

# Features
This project supports the following types of Energy Management in Aircraft

## 1.Source Management:
 If sources are available that can be connected in parallel one can apply a source management,that controls the different sources or generators in an energy efficient way.An intelligent source management will regulate the several sources to reach the overall power losses
 ## 2.Electrical Storage Device:
  The degree of freedom of an energy management methodincreases considerably if electrical storage devices like bat-teries or supercaps are available. Storages can be used tosmooth out the power consumption of load groups. This in turnenables to design lighter generators, feeders, and convertersespecially in case of many non-constant loads. However, thebatteries or supercaps will add weight. Thus, there will bean optimal tradeoff between installed battery-capacity andinstalled power of e.g. generators to minimize weight
  ## 3.Exploit Slow Responding Roads:
   In today's aircraft systems there is a number of slowresponding loads. That is systems and components with largetime constants like heaters. Since electrical storages will addweight, one can also try to decrease power peaks by exploitingsuch slow responding loads (SRL). Thus, they can be handledlike an electrical storage since they store energy in theirrespective physical state like the heat of a galley oven.
  ## 4.Variable Prorities:
    To consider the changing importance of loads during a ﬂightone can simply use variable priorities instead of ﬁxed ones.Thus, the priority can be determined by the loads themselvesdepending on their current importance.
  ## 5.Supervise Reconnection
    Instead of shedding loads if an overload occurs, one canalso prevent loads from being reconnected if a dedicatedpower level is reached.
